# Religion-and-Politics-GVPT-289-L
This repository contains the slides for the undergraduate course Religions, Beliefs, and World Affairs at University of Maryland, College Park. The slides were done using R presentation in RStudio. 

The course was ministered by Professor John McCauley. I worked as a teaching assistant responsible for three section of twenty students each. 

The repository has three folders; one for the .rpres files, one for the images used in the .rpres, and a final one with a basic template of the .rpres

# Acknowledgment

I thank Professor John McCauley for the opportunity to work together in this course. As well as, Eric Dunford for providing a first template of the 
.rpres file.
